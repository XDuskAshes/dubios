dubios documentation



Using:
Local disk should have the following:
/boot/
/boot/db/
and within /boot/db/, a boot.db file.
Inside this file, include the path to the booting file you wish to use.
dubios will check and make sure it's executable.

A outside disk should have the same files.
Please note that you dont have to do:

/path/to/booting/file.lua

You instead only have to do

path/to/booting/file.lua

Due to dubios's handling of disk paths.
