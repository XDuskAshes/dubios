Path Handling: How dubios handles local vs disk paths

Local:
Start from root ("/")
Search for "/boot/db/boot.db"
Uses contents of the boot.db file and searches for the defined file.

Disk:
Start from disk root. ("/disk/", or "/disk0/" and so forth)
Search for "/disk/boot/db/boot.db"
Uses contents of the boot.db file and searches for the defined file, searching from the disk root instead.
